            <p>
                I became an architect graduate from <a href="https://www.its.ac.id/arsitektur/">The Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember (abbreviated as ITS)</a>
                Surabaya, Indonesia, on the 1st November, 1980.

                In life, there is not much opportunities for many people, 
                so take what others offer and don't take things for granted. 
                Small opportunities are often the beginning of great enterprises. 
                If I want to lead my life successfully and happily, 
                be alert and prepared to hear the call of the opportunity 
                that may come at any moment. My journey began when
                my ex-university architect friend of mine invited me 
                in a WhatsApp group. I saw a friend of mine who lives 
                in America posting a lot of good graphic design, 
                she motivated me to start learning about 
                'how to make a good presentation posting'. I started to 
                learn graphic design on my own from my mobile phone using 
                numerous free apps such as Snapseed to Adobe Creative Cloud Express.
                In two years time, I made more than two thousand designs and 
                I always enjoy spending my time designing. My productivity for 
                designing made me feel the need to get more exposure, 
                and that's why I chose to learn web development.</p> 
            <p>
            In order to display my design online and garner more public interest, I started learning web development at <a href="https://bootcamp.uwa.edu.au/coding/landing/?s=Google-Brand&pkw=%2Buwa%20%2Bcoding%20%2Bbootcamp&pcrid=494735218547&pmt=b&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=GGL%7CUNIVERSITY-OF-WESTERN-AUSTRALIA%7CSEM%7CCODING%7C-%7COFL%7CTIER-1%7CALL%7CBRD%7CBMM%7CCore%7CBootcamp&utm_term=%2Buwa%20%2Bcoding%20%2Bbootcamp&utm_content=494735218547&s=google&k=%2Buwa%20%2Bcoding%20%2Bbootcamp&gclid=CjwKCAjw3cSSBhBGEiwAVII0Z7i4MwLRSfnZiPRkIRS62Z55kXvEEoQsj8i3LO-iiNGi4mbaHy-0HhoCOJAQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds">Coding Bootcamp The University of Western Australia (UWA)</a> on the 7th February 2022.
            I have enjoyed learning a variety of things. In two months time, I displayed my work: Password Generator, Code Quiz, Day Planner and Weather Dasboard. Also, I have finished my first project with a team member BCKS. 
            You can click on Updated-Portfolio-Page-1 to view my first two months work. Ater four months I have made another progress, I displayed my work: Professional README Generator, Team Profile Generator, Note Taker, Employee Tracker, E-Commerce Backend, Tech-Blog and Project-2 Password Manager.
